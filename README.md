# TeamFlash

TeamFlash is a super simple tool for connecting TeamCity to a Delcom USB build light.

It's tested with the [Delcom 904003](http://www.delcomproducts.com/productdetails.asp?productnum=904003) and [Delcom 804003](http://www.delcomproducts.com/productdetails.asp?productnum=804003) (old generation).

## Installing

1. Grab [the compiled bits, hot off our build server](https://tc.readifycloud.com/viewLog.html?buildTypeId=bt10&buildId=lastSuccessful&tab=artifacts&guest=1)
2. Run them
3. There is no installer

## Outputs

Red = one or more builds are broken, and not being investigated
Amber = all builds are either under investigation (requires TeamCity 7.1), or passing
Green = all builds are passing

Paused builds are ignored.

## Code

â€¦is moderately average. We know. We hacked it together on a client site eons ago, then published it when we wanted to re-use it elsewhere. Don't hate us: send a pull request instead.

We also know that there are other projects that do the same thing, like [SouthsideSoftware/TeamCityBuildLight](https://github.com/SouthsideSoftware/TeamCityBuildLight). We wrote this a while ago, and wanted to publish it anyway.
